KBC –Kaun Banega crorepati

It is a core python game which refers to the fundamental and essential aspects of the Python programming language, these python code creates a fun quiz game inspired by KBC. This game is based on Indian televiosion show having best entertainment plateform and contain general knowledge and awareness about all national and international data, It contains fewer lines of code than other programming languages, such as Java. With fewer lines of code, there's less attack surface for bugs. This project is created just for learning purpose or you can also improve your quizzing skills. This core python project have some amazing concepts like if you will give correct answer then continue with game otherwise, automatically result will displayed at your screen.

Features:-

a) Multiple lifelines with limited uses (e.g., 50/50 or audience poll)

b) You will get unique question everytime

c) Your score is Stored to Database

d) You can watch your high Score

e)A timer for each question (increases difficulty)

f)Difficulty levels with different question sets


Overview of project:-

Understanding of lists and tuples: The code uses lists to store questions, answers, and prize money. You’ll see how lists can be manipulated and accessed to manage game data. Tuples are used for options that shouldn’t change, like the answer choices (A, B, C, D).

Working with functions: The code is divided into functions for specific tasks like answering questions and running the game loop. This promotes code reusability and organization.

Using conditional statements: The code uses if statements to check user input, evaluate answers, and determine game flow based on the player’s choices.

Iteration with loops: The game loop uses a while loop to iterate through questions until the player exits or completes the quiz.

Basic game structure: By following the code structure, you’ll gain insight into how to design a simple question-and-answer game with user interaction.
